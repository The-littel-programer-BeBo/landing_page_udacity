### After being accused of plagiarism
1. I changed the function to add a new section and a new link
2. I didn't change the function of adding and removing activity using Element.getBoundingClientRect because I think it's the best way to do it and I already did it myself after understanding its method like the rest of the functions
3. I put static sections on the page and changed the function of adding static sections on the page to work in case there are fewer sections than required and add a link for each section that already exists
